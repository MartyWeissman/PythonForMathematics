        "As before, Python interprets an operation (`**`) differently in different contexts.  When given integer input, Python evaluates `2**1000` **exactly**.  The result is a large integer.  A nice fact about Python, for mathematicians, is that it handles exact integers of arbitrary length!  Many other programming languages (like C++) will give an error message if integers get too large in the midst of a computation.  \n",

        "New in version 3.x, Python implements long integers without giving signals to the programmer or changing types.  In Python 2.x, there were two types: *int* for somewhat small integers (e.g., up to $2^{31}$) and *long* type for all larger integers.  Python 2.x would signal which type of integer was being used, by placing the letter \"L\" at the end of a long integer.  Now, in Python 3.x, the programmer doesn't really see the difference.  There is only the *int* type.  But Python still optimizes computations, using hardware functionality for arithmetic of small integers and custom routines for large integers.  The programmer doesn't have to worry about it most of the time.\n",

If one computes the floating point exponent `2.0**1000`, the result is a decimal approximation.  It is still a float.  The expression \"e+301\" stands for \"multiplied by 10 to the 301st power\", i.e., Python uses *scientific notation* for large floats."
