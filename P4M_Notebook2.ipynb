Your computer has some (4 or 8 or 16, perhaps) gigabytes of memory (RAM).  A gigabyte is a billion bytes, and a byte is enough memory to store a number between 0 and 255.

But in this setting, it is safe, and makes no real difference to the Python interpreter.  Instead of creating new variables called `dividend` and `divisor`, one can manipulate `a` and `b` directly within the function.  If you do this, the GCD function can be shortened to the following."

It almost [matches the GCD code in a standard Python library](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18944210).  It might be slightly faster than our original code -- but there is a tradeoff here between execution speed and readability of code.  In this and the following lessons, we often optimize enough for everyday purposes, but not so much that readability is lost."

Hint:  the function should contain the lines `j = 2` and `while j < n:` and `j = j + 1` in various places.  Why might this be an improvement from the for loop?  Can you look for factors within a smaller range?\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  When $a$ and $b$ are integers, $GCD(a,b) \\cdot LCM(a,b) = ab$.  Use this fact to write an LCM-function.  Try to make your function output only integers (not floats) and behave in a good way even if $a,b$ are zero.\n",
