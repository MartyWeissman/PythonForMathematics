In the older version, Python 2.x, the range command `range(2,n)` would have tried to store the entire list of numbers `[2,3,4,...,n-1]` in the memory of your computer.  Your computer has some (4 or 8 or 16, perhaps) gigabytes of memory (RAM).  A gigabyte is a billion bytes, and a byte is enough memory to store a number between 0 and 255.  (More detail about this later!).  So a gigabyte will not even hold a billion numbers.
