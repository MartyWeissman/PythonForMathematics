        "**Python** is a programming language, and this course is all about learning Python to solve problems.  There are lots of ways to use Python.  For example, if you have a Mac, you can open a terminal window (open \"Terminal\" app), type \"python\" at the prompt, and you'll be greeted by a python prompt (it looks like \">>>\").  If you type \"2+2\", Python will output \"4\" -- congratulations!  You've run Python in your terminal.\n",

This is a **Jupyter notebook** -- you're reading a Jupyter notebook right now!  Jupyter notebooks are made of **text cells** like the one you're reading now, and **code cells** that contain **code** -- Python code for our course.\n",

If so, you'll see a orange \"CO\" logo at the top of your browser window, and maybe links to your Google profile too.  By using Google CoLab, you won't have to install any software on your computer.  You'll also be able to work collaboratively (what \"CoLab\" stands for) with your classmates.  You will need an internet connection though.  If you don't have regular internet access, but you do have a reliable computer, you can use **Anaconda** instead to install all the Python packages, Jupyter notebook server, etc. -- all for free.\n",

GitHub will allow you to keep track of different versions of files, submit your final work for grading, receive feedback, etc.  And you can keep your notebooks on GitHub in the long term, for future enjoyment."
