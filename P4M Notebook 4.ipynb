These packages extend the capability of Python by defining new types which are highly optimized for floating-point and fixed-size integer computation.  They also extend the capability of Python by introducing new list-like types that allow multi-dimensional arrays (like matrices) and allow \"broadcasting\" -- the seemingly-simultaneous application of functions to all terms of such an array.\n",

A list like `L = [1,2,3]` has a zeroth, first, and second item (or \"element\" or \"entry\"), which can be retrieved with `L[0]` or `L[1]` or `L[2]`.  For matrices, or other multidimensional arrangements, one might wish for a list which is \"doubly-indexed\" -- something where the entries would be retrieved with a command like `L[1,2]` (for something in the 1st row and 2nd column).  It's possible to make this work in plain Python by using lists of lists.  For example, if `M = [[1,2],[3,4]]` is a list of lists, then you can retrieve numbers with commands like `M[0][1]`.  But this gets a bit cumbersome and is not optimized for typical operations on matrices.\n",

Use numpy to create a array with 50 rows and 10 columns of random dice rolls (random integers between 1 and 6).  By summing rows, create an array of numbers between 10 and 60.  What is the average of this array (a number between 10 and 60)?  What is the standard deviation of this array?  (Use the `np.std` function for standard deviation.)  Use numpy functions throughout -- no loops please!  \n",

When `e` is zero, the function should output the identity matrix `np.eye(s)` where `s` is the number of rows (or columns) of `M`.\n",

        "To understand how this works, it is helpful to understand a bit more about light, computer monitors, and images-as-data.  Light is electromagnetic radiation, and it travels through space in waves.  Light waves with a wavelength of about 400-700 nanometers stimulate cells on our retina, and therefore are *visible*.  Longer wavelength light includes infrared, microwave, and radio waves.  Shorter wavelength light includes ultraviolet and x-rays.\n",
        "\n",
        "For most of us, our retinas contain 3 types of \"cone cells\" which are responsive to different wavelengths of light.  Some are most responsive to light in the low 400 nm range, others to light in the low 500nm range, others in the mid 500nm range.  Signals from these three kinds of cells get passed to the brain, and we are able to distinguish between different wavelengths (in the 400-700nm range) by which cells are more or less activated.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you see light purely in the 400-450 nm range, it looks pretty blue, whereas light at the 650-700 nm range looks pretty red.  A typical red laser pointer shines light that's close to 650nm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your computer monitor contains millions of *pixels* -- extremely tiny these days (often below 100 micrometers square).  Each pixel contains a red, a blue, and a green subpixel.  Each of these subpixels is individually dimmable, and is often set between 0 (completely off) and 255 (completely on).  In this way, each pixel can be black (red = 0, blue = 0, green = 0) or bright pure red (red = 255, blue = 0, green = 0) or white (red = 255, blue = 255, green = 255).\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand how this makes \"white\" or \"yellow\" or all the other colors in the rainbow, you need to understand an *additive* color scheme as well as how light is perceived.  When light of multiple wavelengths hits your retina, your brain perceives a certain color.  In fact, if light of a red wavelength (680nm) and green wavelength (510nm) hits your retina at the same time, your brain will see it exactly the same as light of a yellow wavelength (560nm).  When you look at a bright yellow picture on your computer monitor, your computer is actually shining red and green light at your retina... the red and green dots are just so tiny and closely packed that your brain doesn't know the difference.\n",

        "The code below creates a 200 by 200 by 3 array of numbers, each between 0 and 255.  But you should think about it as a 200 by 200 array of quadruples of the form `[red value, green value, blue value]`.  Each value can be between 0 and 255 -- it is represented as a np.uint8.\n",
        "\n",
        "This array is then turned into a PIL Image with the `Image.fromarray` function.  Then the PIL function `display` displays the image.  Notice how red+green looks yellow.  Experiment with the red, green, and blue values to see what happens!\n"
